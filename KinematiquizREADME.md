Kinematiquiz is an interactive Java-based physics trivia games that generates random trivia questions for people to answer, some of which invovle graphing questions. This program is designed for Physics students to test their knowledge in kinematics, so it's highly recommended to
for general users to review kinematics(including graphs) which is covered in AP Physics 1 or AP Physics C before trying the quiz. The random generation is used using Java rand functions from imported libraries and the graphs are
created using 2D arrays in Java. The graphing questions require more kinematics, geometry or calculus, and algebra knowledge to solve. A video link is at the bottom of this document.
1. All questions are  randomly generated and  asks for your answer as an input. If it's correct, the program will say correct, if it's incorrect the program will say incorrect
   and show the right answer. Some questions are multiple choice, short answer, or  true/false. Other questionsn involve typing an equation and the program graphs it for you. 
2. When encountering a graphing question, it will ask if you want a solution. If you say "yes", it will ask for one value and when entering a value it will input it in a y function and show the y solution
 and the program asks the user for another value and the same program ouput is given. Then the user is challenged to figure out the equation based 
3.  An example for a graphing question is a user enters in 2 and the hidden y function is 2x, then the solution would show 4. It is highly recommended to first ask the value 0 to see if there's any constant(e.g. y = 2x+3) and
   then based on the pattern you see in the graph input a guess such as 2. If you get 4, subtract that from the first solution and divide that by the difference of the first and
  second values((4-0)/(2-0)= 2) to calculate the slope. Since the solution at 0 is 0 the constant is 0. Therefore the equation is y = 2x.It is then up to the student or user who is expected to know physics
  concepts to use that equation and plug in values figured out in the question. This question is one of the most intensive questions and requires the student or user to have studied kinematics very well and use
  this program as a way to test their knowledge to prepare for the quiz. Calculus is very helpful, but at least geometry
  and algebra would be required to solve these type of problems.
4. The program has 10 questions but runs 21 times and some of the questions can repeated. This is more of a helpful tool for students to quiz themselves.

I do agree that the program could help with more updates by including more practice questions which file parsing could help, being more clear in displaying the x and y values in
graphing questions, and also a points system  to make the quiz be more creative and game-like Hopefully, as these updates continue this program can help students excel in kinematics.
